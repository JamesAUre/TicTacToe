# TicTacToe - first readme (HYPE)
simple tic-tac-toe game I made to quickly learn java objects and simple syntax before the semester starts

Uses 3 classes:
- Main for the game interface and backbone
- Board for storing all the pieces and checking player turns + win conditions (can be further decomposed into smaller classes)
- Pieces for storing the value of each piece on the board

Uses console print commands for the user interface and scanners to register userinput

Through this process I have learned how to get my github working effectively with my eclipse compiler
I have focused on good programming practices such as being able to take a back up of all my work, comment and encapsulate code
